    - Certificate authentication
  - Site-to-Site (S2S)
    - Active/Passive vs Active/Active
    - BGP support
    
- **ExpressRoute**
  - Circuit SKUs and features
  - Peering options (Private, Microsoft, Public)
  - FastPath (Ultra Performance)
  - Global Reach
  
- **Virtual WAN**
  - Hub and Spoke at scale
  - Branch connectivity
  - Inter-hub networking

- Consider bandwidth requirements

## üìù Exam Tips

### Common Scenario Types
1. **Hybrid Connectivity**
   - Choose between ExpressRoute, VPN, and Virtual WAN
   - Determine appropriate SKUs and redundancy

2. **Security Requirements**
   - Implement proper network isolation
   - Choose between NSGs, Azure Firewall, and NVAs
   - Design Private Link solutions

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Select appropriate load balancing solutions
   - Optimize routing paths
   - Choose correct SKUs

### Remember
- Always consider cost implications
- Focus on enterprise-scale solutions
- Prioritize security and compliance
- Consider operational overhead

## üîç Design Decision Framework

When designing network solutions, consider:

1. **Connectivity Requirements**
   - Bandwidth needs
   - Latency requirements
   - Geographic distribution
   - Reliability requirements

2. **Security Requirements**
   - Regulatory compliance
   - Data sovereignty
   - Traffic inspection needs
   - Isolation requirements

3. **Operational Requirements**
   - Monitoring needs
   - Management overhead
   - Team expertise
   - Budget constraints

## Best Practices

### Private Endpoint
- Plan DNS strategy early
- Consider hub-spoke implications
- Account for additional costs
- Plan IP addressing carefully

### Service Endpoint
